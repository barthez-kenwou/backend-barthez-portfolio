# Architecture Decision Records

This folder records significant technical decisions for Backend Init.

## Format

Each ADR is numbered and immutable once accepted. Superseding a decision means
writing a new ADR that references the old one.

Suggested sections: **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**.

## When to write an ADR

Write one when you:

- Change persistence technology or auth scheme
- Introduce a new cross-cutting framework (DI, CQRS bus, ORM)
- Split or merge bounded contexts in a breaking way
- Adopt a hard dependency rule that contributors must follow
